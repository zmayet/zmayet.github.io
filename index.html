      <h3>Zainab Mayet</h3>
      <p> My interest in technology was recently stemmed after completing my two-year course
	 in Computing and IT at College, which not only drove me to study the subject further 
	 at University but inspired me to pursue a future career in this field. My eagerness and 
	determination to develop my career in Computer Science has since been fuelled by my 
	intriguing course in Computing and IT at college where I was first exposed to the world of
	coding and programming. One of our first projects within our coding unit was ‘Hello World’,
	where I was fascinated by how a series of code could create a program. Although the program 
	itself was extremely basic, I began to understand the concept and how these procedures lead
	great coders in creating the vast amount of programs we have available today.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Car Animation</h3>
    <p>
	The duration of Bootcamp lasted 2 weeks which enabled us to develop a set of
	skills to develop our own unique project.In order to showcase our skills I had
	decided to develop a small animation of cars racing, which involved a variety of 
	codes including: arrays, loops, if statements, randomness e.t.c. Once the user clicks
	anywhere on the screen this will spark a set of codes to be carried out, meaning the cars
	will not move unless the screen has been clicked. Therefore, when the screen has been 
	clicked, random variables will be set for each car so every time the program is excecutes
	a different car will win the race. I had also added an animation background to give the effect
	of rain, as well as a message to appear when either car wins the race.
